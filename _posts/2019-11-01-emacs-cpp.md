Emacs is my favourite editor for any type of coding, planning or journaling. To wield it's full power it must be used in daemon and GUI mode (CLI mode is fine, but is nowhere near as powerful as the GUI).
In this article I'm going to share how to make Emacs a great C++ editor. The very minimum you will need is lsp-mode, company-lsp and ccls. Here is the config:


{% highlight elisp %}

(use-package lsp-mode :commands lsp :ensure t)
(use-package lsp-ui :commands lsp-ui-mode :ensure t)
(use-package company-lsp
  :ensure t
  :commands company-lsp
  :config (push 'company-lsp company-backends)) ;; add company-lsp as a backend


(use-package ccls
  :ensure t
  :config
  (setq ccls-executable "ccls")
  (setq lsp-prefer-flymake nil)
  (setq-default flycheck-disabled-checkers '(c/c++-clang c/c++-cppcheck c/c++-gcc))
  :hook ((c-mode c++-mode objc-mode) .
         (lambda () (require 'ccls) (lsp))))

{% endhighlight %}


With just this setup, we get the following:

Other useful emacs packages are yasnippet (and of course yasnippet-snippets), helm (or ivy), projectile and the great magit.
