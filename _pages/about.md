Welcome! I specialize in high performance software development. Typically I am writing code for supercomputers, AWS clusters, accelerators (e.g. GPUs), or optimizing existing codes that need a speed boost. Please get in touch if you need assistance in developing fast parallel code for single-board machines or massively parallel supercomputers.

Here you'll find my full resume as well as links to my github, google scholar and other ways to contact/follow me.
I also write the occasional blog post.
